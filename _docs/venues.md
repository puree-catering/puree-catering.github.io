## Introduction to Venue Management

The venue management feature in Puree caters to businesses that not only offer catering services but also manage venue bookings. This integration allows for a seamless approach to include venue charges in quotes and oversee venue reservations through a comprehensive calendar view.

## Enabling Venue Management

To access the venue management feature, it must first be enabled on your account:

1. **Contact Support:** Reach out to Puree support to request the activation of the venue management feature on your account.
2. **Access the Feature:** Once enabled, you will notice a new 'Venues' button on your dashboard, allowing you to start adding and managing venues.

1. **Navigate to Venues:** Click on the 'Venues' button on your dashboard.
2. **Create New Venue:** Click on the 'New Venue' button and fill in the details of your venue, such as name, location, and any other relevant information.

## Managing Reservations and Items

Venues in Puree require two main components: reservations and items.

- **Reservations:** These are time slots that can be booked for the venue, such as all-day hires or wedding hires. Each reservation can have a specific charge associated with it.
- **Items:** These include additional charges related to the venue, such as cleaning fees, equipment rentals (e.g., gas heaters, sound systems), and any other venue-specific charges.

### Adding Reservations and Items

1. **Define Reservations:** Set up various reservation types based on your needs, specifying the duration and associated cost for each.
2. **List Venue Items:** Add items that can be charged in addition to the reservation fee, specifying the price for each item.

## Venue Reservations Calendar

The venue feature includes a calendar view for managing reservations:

- **View Reservations:** Access the calendar to see all current and upcoming reservations for each venue.
- **Google Calendar Integration:** Each venue can be linked to a Google Calendar, ensuring that updates in Puree are reflected in Google Calendar for easy access on mobile devices.

## Including Venues in Quotes

When preparing a quote, the venue component is prominently displayed:

1. **Select Venue and Reservation:** In the quote editor, you can select the desired venue and specify the reservation type, start time, and end time.
2. **Add Venue Items:** Choose any additional venue-related items to include in the quote.
3. **Customize with Commentary:** Add custom text to provide context or additional information about the venue booking in the quote.

## Custom Templates
