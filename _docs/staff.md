2. **Estimation vs. Actuals:** It's advisable for caterers to provide an upfront estimate of staff hours in the initial quote to enhance transparency with clients. After the event, should the actual staff hours vary from the initial estimate, you can adjust the quote accordingly. 

3. **Adding a Note for Estimates:** Utilise the commentary template section to include a note that staff costs are estimated and subject to final calculation post-event.  

## Event Staff Rosters

Within the Logistics tab, Puree provides an "Event Staff Roster" feature. This section offers a concise summary of all the event staff required for upcoming events, displayed in an easily understandable table format. This table can be seamlessly utilised to organise staff rosters within your preferred rostering software. Additionally, Puree includes automated reminders to ensure that you remember to create these essential rosters on time. For more detailed instructions on leveraging this feature, please refer to our comprehensive guide [here](/docs/tasks).
