## Introduction

Setting up clear terms and conditions for your catering services is crucial for ensuring both you and your customers have a mutual understanding of the service expectations. Puree makes it easy to integrate these into your quotes.

## Before You Begin

- **Draft Your Terms and Conditions:** Prepare a comprehensive list of terms that cover all aspects of your service, including payment terms, cancellation policies, and service scope.
- **Consider Different Scenarios:** If you offer different services (e.g., event catering vs. venue management), you may need separate terms for each.

## Adding Terms and Conditions

### Accessing the Settings

1. **Navigate to Settings:** From the main dashboard, locate and select the settings option to find the terms and conditions section.

### Creating Terms and Conditions

1. **Add New Terms:** Click on the option to add new terms and conditions.
2. **Title and Content:** Give your terms a clear title and input the detailed conditions. This can be a general set for all services or specific to particular offerings.
3. **Save:** Confirm and save your terms and conditions.

### Managing Multiple Terms

- **For Different Services:** You can create and save multiple sets of terms and conditions if your catering service requires different agreements for various types of events or venues.

## Applying Terms and Conditions to Quotes

1. **Selecting Terms for a Quote:** When creating or editing a quote, you'll find an option to select the appropriate terms and conditions from your templates.
2. **Customer Visibility:** The selected terms and conditions will be automatically included at the bottom of the customer's quote, ensuring they are aware of the policies before accepting.

## Best Practices

- **Update Regularly:** Review and update your terms and conditions regularly to reflect any changes in your service or legal requirements.
- **Clear Communication:** Ensure your terms are clear, concise, and easily understandable to avoid any misunderstandings.
