### Step 2: Upload Your Logo

- **Brand Identity:** Upload your company logo under `Account Details`. This step is important for branding your quotes and invoices.

### Step 3: Configure Menu Headers

- **Menu Organization:** Access `Settings` and update your menu headers. Menu headers are essential for categorizing your items effectively in quotes, providing a clear and professional presentation to your clients.
- **Customization:** You can create custom headers such as `Morning Tea`, grouping relevant items like scones and sausage rolls under this header. This categorization enhances the clarity and appeal of your quotes.

### Step 4: Set Up Commentary Templates

- **Terms and Conditions:** One of the first commentary templates to focus on is your `Terms and Conditions`. This template is vital for ensuring your quotes include all legal and operational details necessary for your services.
- **Creating Templates:** Navigate to `Commentary Templates` in your settings. You may start with a single, default set of terms and conditions and expand to include templates for different event types, such as weddings, to streamline the quoting process.

### Step 5: Introduction and Category Commentary

- **Personalize Your Quotes:** Use commentary templates to add personalized text at the top of your quotes. This feature allows you to tailor messages for specific types of events, enhancing the customer experience.

## Final Thoughts

Taking the time to properly set up your Puree.app account with accurate details, custom menu headers, and thoughtful commentary templates lays a solid foundation for efficient and effective catering operations.
