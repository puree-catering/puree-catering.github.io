## Setting Up the Integration

To begin using the Puree-Xero integration, follow these steps to connect Puree with Xero:

1. **Navigate to Settings:** In Puree, go to your account settings and select the Integrations tab.
2. **Connect to Xero:** Find Xero in the list of integrations and click on the 'Connect' button. You'll be redirected to Xero to authorize Puree's access.
3. **Choose Your Accounts:** Once connected, select which of your existing Xero accounts correspond to different category types in Puree.

## Syncing Quotes and Invoices between Puree and Xero

### Linking Customers and Quotes to Xero

- **Initial Customer Link:** The first step in the integration process involves linking a quote in Puree to a corresponding customer in Xero. This is done by pulling customer information from the Xero API. Once a customer has been linked between Puree and Xero, the connection is remembered for future transactions for that customer.

- **Connecting Quotes to Xero:** For each quote, users must actively connect it to Xero within Puree. This link ensures that any updates made to the quote in Puree are automatically reflected in the corresponding draft invoice in Xero that has been created by Puree.

### Invoice Management in Xero

- **Draft Invoices:** Invoices created through this process appear in Xero in draft form. Users are required to approve these invoices in Xero before they can be sent out to customers. `If you make a change in Xero directly to the invoice, this will not be reflected in the Puree quote. This is referred as a one-way-sync.`

### Handling Payments and Updates

- **Impact of Payments on Syncing:** If a payment or part payment is made against an invoice in Xero, subsequent updates made to the Puree quote will not be reflected in the Xero invoice. Users will be alerted to this discrepancy with a warning in Puree when attempting to edit the quote.

- **Viewing Invoice Status in Puree:** Users can view the payment status of an invoice directly in Puree by hovering over the Xero button on the quote index page. Although payments cannot be processed within Puree, this feature allows for quick and easy monitoring of invoice statuses.

## Benefits of Integration

The Puree-Xero integration brings several advantages to your catering business:

- **Efficiency:** Reduces the time spent on financial administration by automating the sync between quoting and accounting invoicing.
- **Accuracy:** Minimizes the risk of manual errors in financial records, ensuring accurate accounting.
- **Visibility:** Offers real-time insights into your business's financial status, improving decision-making.

## Conclusion

Integrating Puree with Xero not only simplifies the financial management of your catering business but also enhances operational efficiency and accuracy. Follow this guide to set up and make the most out of your Puree-Xero integration.
