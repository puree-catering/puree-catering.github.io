## An update

In today's release, we updated the view of items and categories in Puree. The new layout is more user-friendly, allowing you to easily view your items by category. We've also introduced a "slideover" feature, enabling you to edit or add new items and categories within the same view.

{% include image.html image='items.png' %}

While we believe the new view is a significant improvement, it also sets the stage for exciting new features we plan to introduce.

## New features coming soon

### Online menus

The next major feature we are working on is the ability for you, our customer, to display your menus on a public URL (website page). Within Puree, you'll have the capability to edit and select items to include in your public menus. The benefit is that you only need to update and maintain your items in a single place â€” Puree.

The public URL will be `www.puree.app/caterer/menu`, and you can link this page from your own website. We will offer some customization options to ensure the menu URL fits with your existing website design, though modifications will be limited. We think you'll appreciate the new design.

### Online orders

Following the release of the menu feature, we'll start working on an online order form that you can embed on your website. This form will allow your customers to place orders directly through your website, and these orders will be automatically pushed to create a draft quote inside Puree, significantly enhancing your workflow and productivity.

We have a design layout for the form that we believe will be more suitable for caterers than typical online stores like Shopify. Additionally, we've decided that the form will not process online payments. Most of our customers prefer to invoice their clients, and handling payments upfront can complicate order updates.

While we can't promise a specific timeline, we have started active development on this feature.

If you are interested in becoming an early trial customer, please reach out to us.
