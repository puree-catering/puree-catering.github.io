We're excited to share a enhancement to [Puree.app](https://puree.app) - our Documents Feature, designed to streamline your catering operations by allowing you to attach and manage documents directly within your quotes.

## Introducing the Documents Feature

The Documents Feature in Puree.app provides a seamless way to include important files within your quotes. Whether it's health and safety document, menus, or photos, you can now keep all relevant files organised and accessible within Puree.

### How It Works:

1. **Upload Your Documents:** Easily upload files to Puree under the 'Documents' section in the settings panel. This can include PDFs, images, or any other document type relevant to your services.
2. **Automatic or Manual Attachment:** Decide whether a document should be automatically attached to all new quotes or if you prefer to attach it manually to specific quotes.
3. **Client Accessibility:** Documents attached to quotes are visible and downloadable by your clients, ensuring they have all the information they need in one place.

## Benefits of Using the Documents Feature

- **Enhanced Organization:** Keep all relevant documents tied to your quotes and orders, reducing the risk of missing information.
- **Improved Client Communication:** Provide your clients with comprehensive quotes that include all necessary documentation for their event.
- **Streamlined Operations:** Save time by automating the attachment of recurring documents to your quotes, allowing you to focus on other aspects of your business.

This update is part of our commitment to providing a comprehensive catering software solution that meets the dynamic needs of our customers.
