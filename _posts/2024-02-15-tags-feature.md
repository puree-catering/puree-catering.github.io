We're excited to announce a new tagging feature in [Puree.app](https://puree.app), designed to enhance the organisation and retrieval of quotes and orders within our catering software solution. 

Tags in Puree offer a flexible way to categorise your business operations, allowing you to quickly access and manage your quotes and orders based on criteria such as event type, venue, or any custom identifier relevant to your operations.

## Creating and Applying Tags

Creating tags is simple:

1. **Navigate** to the 'Tags' section within the settings menu.
2. **Add** a new tag with a unique identifier, such as "Wedding" or "Boat Shed."
3. **Customise** your tag with a distinctive colour to easily distinguish between different tags.

Applying tags to your quotes and orders is straightforward, enhancing the efficiency of your event planning and management processes.

## Streamlining Operations with Tags

The tagging feature allows for enhanced organisation, efficient filtering, and customisation of your operations, making it simpler to manage a large volume of entries and ensuring quick access to specific types of orders or quotes.
